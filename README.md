# Operating-Platforms

### Summary of the project:
This portfolio item includes the complete software design document artifact from the Operating Platforms course at SNHU. This design document demonstrates my ability to be effective in working through the design of a software application and to communicate it effectively to a client and my development team members. For this design document, I imagined working for a fictitious technology consultant, Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), who has been retained by a new client, The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room is a gaming company that owns a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that is available as an Android application. In order to scale their business and increase their customer base, The Gaming Room plans on expanding their Draw It or Lose It game onto multiple operating platforms as a web-based game. In this fictitious scenario, The Gaming Room has retained the services of CTS to set up the distributed environment and develop the web-based version of the Draw It or Lose It game. 

Draw It or Lose It is broadly similar to a game from a TV show from the 1980s called Win, Lose or Draw, where the contestant teams competed to guess the object or thing being drawn on an easel. For the Draw It or Lose It game, the application will render images selected from a large library of stock images as clues. These images will be partially rendered at a constant rate until the 30-second mark, when the images will be fully rendered. Each game will consist of four rounds of play, each round lasting one minute. The starting order of teams will rotate at the start of each round to guess the puzzle before the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle within that time, each of the remaining team(s) will be able to guess once to solve the puzzle within a 15-second time limit. 


### What did I do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing this design document, I demonstrated proficiency in the following:
- Summarizing the problem and the solution with outline
- Identifying the design constraints of setting up a web-based distributed environment
- Describing the relationships between classes and the object-oriented programming principles in the class diagram
- Evaluating various operating platforms for:
    - server-side characteristics and capabilities
    - client-side characteristics and capabilities
    - relevant development languages and tools used for software development
- Providing recommendations on appropriate operating platform to meet the client's requirements, and,
- Describing the architectures for the recommended operating platform
- Describing the recommended storage management solution for the recommended operating platform
- Describing the memory management solution for the recommended operating platform
- Describing the solution for the distributed systems and networks requirements
- Describing the security solutions for the recommended operating platform

### What about the process of working through a design document did I find helpful when developing the code?
Analyzing the UML diagram for the proposed system was helpful in developing the code. 

### If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, what would I pick? How would I improve it?
One part I would like to revise is the Evaluation section, particularly the Development Tools section. I would like to conduct more research on the available tools and languages for each operating platforms, which will lend itself to my ability to evaluate, compare, and contrast each of the operating platforms.

### How did I interpret the user’s needs and implement them into my software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user needs by performing static testing on the work products such as the project guidelines and specifications, and the user stories. It is critical to consider the user needs, as the needs often dictate the requirements of the software. 

### How did I approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would I use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
